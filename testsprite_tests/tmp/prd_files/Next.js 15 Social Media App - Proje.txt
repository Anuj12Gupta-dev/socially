Key Patterns
Server Components - Leveraging Next.js 15 server components for data fetching
Client Components - Using "use client" directive for interactive features
API Routes - RESTful endpoints for backend functionality
Middleware - Authentication and authorization checks
Prisma Schema - Centralized database schema definition
How It Works
Data Flow
Page Requests - Next.js handles routing and SSR/SSG
API Calls - Server components fetch data via API routes or direct Prisma calls
Client Interactions - React Query manages client state and mutations
Database Operations - Prisma ORM handles database interactions
Real-time Updates - Stream Chat provides WebSocket connections for messaging
Authentication Flow
User visits login page
OAuth redirect to Google
Callback to Next.js API route
Lucia creates session and sets cookie
Protected routes validate session
Content Creation Flow
User opens post editor
Media uploaded to UploadThing
Post submitted via API route
Database updated with Prisma
Cache invalidated with React Query
UI updated optimistically
This modernized project follows current best practices for Next.js development with a focus on performance, developer experience, and maintainability.
